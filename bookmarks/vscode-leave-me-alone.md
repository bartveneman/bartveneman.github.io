> Latest version of my “leave me alone, VSC” configuration. Quick thread about each setting to explain what it does (when I even know) and why I don’t use it. As usual, YMMV.

Hugo shares some of his leave-me-alone settings for VS Code.

```json

  "editor.acceptSuggestionOnCommitCharacter": false,

  "git.enabled": false,
  "keyboard.touchbar.enabled": false,
  "workbench.enableExperiments": false,
  "workbench.tips.enabled": false,

}
```
