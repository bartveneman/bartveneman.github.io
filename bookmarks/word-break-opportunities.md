> ðŸ”¥ Have you heard about the &lt;wbr> tag?

> Use the &lt;wbr> tag to define word break opportunities. If the text can be displayed on one line, it wonâ€™t break. If thereâ€™s not enough space, it will.

```html
<p>
  If there isn't enough space
  this paragraph will break here, <wbr>
  if there is enough space, it won't.
</p>
```
