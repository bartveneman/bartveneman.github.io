> Inclusive language plays a critical role in fostering an environment where everyone belongs. At Twitter, the language we have been using in our code does not reflect our values as a company or represent the people we serve. We want to change that. #WordsMatter

> Weâ€™re starting with a set of words we want to move away from using in favor of more inclusive language, such as:

| Avoid non-inclusive language | Prefer inclusive versions |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Whitelist | Allowlist, safelist |
| Blacklist | Denylist |
| Master/Slave | Primary/Secondary, Primary/Replica |
| Man hours | Engineer hours |
| Sanity check | Quick check, coherence check |
| Dummy value | Placeholder value, sample value |
