	<h1>Uses</h1>
	<p>
		No-one ever asks me what software or hardware I use, so I'll write it down
		here.
	</p>

	<h2>Editor &amp; terminal</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noopener external"

			is my default editor, because of the performance and sheer amount of
			plugins it provides. It allows me to do pretty much anything I want. That
			includes using Atom keybindings.
		</li>
		<li>
			It's hard to find anywhere, but I use the
			<a

			in VS Code. Great contrast and not too many different colors.
		</li>
		<li>
			‚ö°Ô∏è <a href="https://hyper.is" rel="external noopener">Hyper</a> is my
			terminal of choice, although the many scrolling and repainting issues I'm
			having with it make me want to go find another terminal. But I really
			don't want to start a search again.

			for Hyper and I'm a sucker for it.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Apps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			ü¶ä
			<a

			keeps me on pretty much the latest available tech, while not having to
			deal with the instability of a nightly build.
		</li>
		<li>
			üëì Whenever I see someone dragging their windows across their monitor
			manually, I cringe. What a waste of time and energy.
			<a href="https://www.spectacleapp.com">Spectacle</a> has made my life so
			much easier, allowing me to instantly make windows full-screen,
			half-screen, top-half-screen and more with only a handful of keyboard
			shortcuts.
		</li>
		<li>
			üé∏ <a href="https://www.spotify.com" rel="noopener external">Spotify</a>.
			Not a single day goes by without it.

			is a good replacement for Google Search. Very rarely (&lt; 1 &times; per
			week) need I search something via Google. DuckDuckGo respects my privacy,
			is pretty fast and gives proper search results, while displaying very
			minimal, non-targeted ads.

	<h2>Hardware</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>üíª One trusty old rusty MacBook Air</li>
		<li>
