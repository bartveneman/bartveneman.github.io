	<h1>Uses</h1>
	<p>
		No-one ever asks me what software or hardware I use, so I'll write it down
		here.
	</p>

	<h2>Editor &amp; terminal</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			ðŸ’¾ <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noopener external"
				>Visual Studio Code</a
			>
			is my default editor, because of the performance and sheer amount of
			plugins it provides. It allows me to do pretty much anything I want. That
			includes using <a rel="noopener external" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-atom-keybindings">Atom keybindings</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			â–² It's hard to find, but I use the

			in VS Code. Great contrast and not too many different colors.

			<a

			and I'm a sucker for it. Great contrast and just enough Git information to get by.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Apps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			ðŸ¦Š
			<a

				rel="noopener external"
				>Firefox Developer Edition</a
			>
			keeps me on pretty much the latest available tech, while not having to
			deal with the instability of a nightly build. In terms of privacy Firefox
			usually seems to do well. The Developer Tools are also great for a frontend
			dev like me.

			ðŸŸ¦ Whenever I see someone dragging their windows across their monitor
			manually, I cringe. What a waste of time and energy.

			<ins><a href="https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle" rel="noopener noreferrer external">Rectangle</a></ins>
			has made my life so
			much easier, allowing me to instantly make windows full-screen,
			half-screen, top-half-screen and more with only a handful of keyboard
			shortcuts.
		</li>
		<li>
			ðŸŽ¸ <a href="https://www.spotify.com" rel="noopener external">Spotify</a>.
			Not a single day goes by without it.

			is a good replacement for Google Search. Very rarely (&lt; 1 &times; per
			week) need I search something via Google. DuckDuckGo respects my privacy,
			is pretty fast and gives proper search results, while displaying very
			minimal, non-targeted ads.

		<li>
			ðŸ‘€ I
			<a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/I6TUXR" rel="external noopener"

			on most of my websites for analytics. Google Analytics and many other
			solutions are way too privacy invasive and Fathoms promise to focus on
			privacy and very minimal analytics is very attractive. Their $14,-/month
			is a small price to pay for much better protection of my visitors. And if
			you click
			<a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/I6TUXR" rel="external noopener"
				>this link</a
			>, you'll get $10 discount on your first invoice. Note: this is a referral
			link, so I would get a discount on my own invoice as well.

	<h2>Hardware</h2>

			monitor since I've been Working From Home and I'm loving it. Power, network and display all in a single USB-C cable on
			a larger-than-strictly-necessary screen. Pricy but worth it!
