	<h1>Uses</h1>
	<p>
		No-one ever asks me what software or hardware I use, so I'll write it down
		here.
	</p>

	<h2>Editor &amp; terminal</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noopener external"

			is my default editor, because of the performance and sheer amount of
			plugins it provides. It allows me to do pretty much anything I want. That
			includes using Atom keybindings.
		</li>
		<li>
			It's hard to find anywhere, but I use the
			<a

				rel="noopener external"
				>Zeit Theme</a
			>
			in VS Code. Great contrast and not too many different colors.
		</li>
		<li>
			‚ö°Ô∏è <a href="https://hyper.is" rel="external noopener">Hyper</a> is my
			terminal of choice, although the many scrolling and repainting issues I'm
			having with it make me want to go find another terminal. But I really
			don't want to start a search again.

			Sindre Sorhus created a
			<a

			for Hyper and I'm a sucker for it.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Apps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			ü¶ä
			<a
				href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/"

				>Firefox Developer Edition</a

			keeps me on pretty much the latest available tech, while not having to
			deal with the instability of a nightly build.
		</li>
		<li>
			üëì Whenever I see someone dragging their windows across their monitor
			manually, I cringe. What a waste of time and energy.
			<a href="https://www.spectacleapp.com">Spectacle</a> has made my life so
			much easier, allowing me to instantly make windows full-screen,
			half-screen, top-half-screen and more with only a handful of keyboard
			shortcuts.
		</li>
		<li>
			üé∏ <a href="https://www.spotify.com" rel="noopener external">Spotify</a>.
			Not a single day goes by without it.

			<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/spread" rel="external noopener"

			is a good replacement for Google Search. Very rarely (&lt; 1 &times; per
			week) need I search something via Google. DuckDuckGo respects my privacy,
			is pretty fast and gives proper search results, while displaying very
			minimal, non-targeted ads.

		<li>
			üëÄ I
			<a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/I6TUXR" rel="external noopener"

			on most of my websites for analytics. Google Analytics and many other
			solutions are way too privacy invasive and Fathoms promise to focus on
			privacy and very minimal analytics is very attractive. Their $14,-/month
			is a small price to pay for much better protection of my visitors. And if
			you click
			<a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/I6TUXR" rel="external noopener"
				>this link</a

	<h2>Hardware</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>üíª One trusty old rusty MacBook Air</li>
		<li>
