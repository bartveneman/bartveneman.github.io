Wes Bos recently published a cool new website: uses.tech. It is a collection of pages like his own /uses page. Lots of developers these days have pages like these to list what hardware, software, plugins and tools they use for their web development work. I find it very inspiring to look at the tools that other developers use, to learn from, to copy their setup or to discover new aproaches to old ideas. I love it. In case anyone is interested in my setup, I created my own /uses page as well.
