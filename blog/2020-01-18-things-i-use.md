title: Things I use
---

Wes Bos recently published a cool new website: [uses.tech](https://uses.tech). It is a collection of pages like [his own](https://wesbos.com/uses/) /uses page. Lots of developers these days have pages like these to list what hardware, software, plugins and tools they use for their web development work. I find it very inspiring to look at the tools that other developers use, to learn from, to copy their setup or to discover new aproaches to old ideas. I love it. In case anyone is interested in my setup, I created [my own /uses](/uses) page as well.
