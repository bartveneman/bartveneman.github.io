	<h1>Bart Veneman</h1>
	<p>
		Welcome to my website. This is where I occasionally write about things related
		to
		<a href="https://www.projectwallace.com" rel="external noopener">Project Wallace</a>, my job as a frontend architect
		at
		<a href="https://www.drukwerkdeal.nl" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Printdeal</a>
		or topics that interest me, like Svelte, State Machines, progressive enhancement,
		online privacy or web performance.
	</p>
	<p>
		Feel free to read some
		<a href="/archive">blog posts</a>, or see the
		<a href="/uses">things I use</a> to move the web forward. Or maybe have a look at the <a href="/plays">musical
			instruments I play</a> if
		you're into that!
